-Docker is a platform for building, running and shipping applications so that applications will work same in every machines.
-Reasons why applications work in one machine, but not in another machine.
	-one or more files missing (wrong deployment)
	-software version mismatch
	-different configuration settings (environment variables)
-with Docker, applications can be packaged with everything it needs and can be run in anywhere.
-Docker run applications in isolated environment.
-once application is not needed anymore, can be removed together without messing the existing things

run an application with dependencies:
	docker-compose up
remove an application with its dependencies:
	docker-compose down --rmi all
	
virtual machine: an abstraction of a machine on a physical hardware. we can run several virtual machines on a real physical machine
Eg: in Windows, mac and linux can be run as virtual machine on top of hypervisor. Hypervisor is a software to create, manage
virtual machines. It's run on top of the operating system.
Hypervisors:
-VirtualBox, VMware (cross platforms)
-Hyper-v (Windows only)

Problems with VMs:
-Each VM needs a full copy of OS with license
-Slow to start since internal operating system has to be loaded just like physicl machine
-Resource intensive since VMs takes actual slices of physical hardware resources like CPU, memory and disk space

container: an isolated environment for running an application
-allow running multiple applications in isolation
-are lightweight. They don't need a full operating system
-use OS of the host. (no need to have secondary license)
-start quickly
-need less hardware resources

architecture:
-uses client-server architecture
-client talks with server using REST API
-server also called as docker engine sits on the background & takes care of building and running docker containers.
-container is just a process.
-all containers of a host share the operating system of the host. They share kernel of the host
(kernel is the core of an operating system)
(A kernel manages applications and hardware resources)
-linx machine only runs linux container.
-but windows machine runs windows + linux container. Because Windows 10 is shifted with custom-built linux kernel in addition to windows kernel.
-for mac, it uses light weight linux VM to run linux container.
